**A/B Testing of Marketing Data**

**Overview**

This project aims to analyze the outcomes of an A/B test comparing two groups—Ad Group and PSA Group—to identify the most effective marketing campaign strategy. By evaluating conversion rates across various timeframes, the study provides actionable insights for optimizing advertising efforts.

**Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to assess the performance differences between the two groups in terms of conversion rates. Key areas of focus include:

Performance by day of the week: Understanding trends across specific days.
Performance by hour of the day: Identifying optimal timeframes for higher engagement.
Methodology
The analysis is conducted in the following steps:

**Data Preparation:**

Import and clean raw data to remove inconsistencies.
Segment the data into groups (Ad Group and PSA Group) by timeframes.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize conversion patterns by days and hours.
Calculate group-wise conversion metrics.

**Statistical Analysis:**

Conduct Z-tests to compare conversion rates, validating whether the observed differences are statistically significant.
Key Findings
**Conversion Rate Analysis:**

The Ad Group consistently showed higher conversion rates compared to the PSA Group.
Notable differences in performance were observed on weekdays, especially during afternoon hours.
**Statistical Significance:**

Results from Z-tests indicated that the performance differences were statistically significant, favoring the Ad Group in most scenarios.

**Conclusion**

Based on the findings:

The Ad Group is the superior performer, achieving higher conversion rates under most conditions.
Future marketing campaigns should prioritize strategies aligned with the Ad Group’s approach, particularly focusing on effective weekdays and afternoon timeframes for maximum impact.
